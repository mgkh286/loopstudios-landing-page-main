## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

using font clamp and margin-block and margin inline or using picture tag .

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Useful resources

- [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp) - This helped me for understanding . I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand clamp for font. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
